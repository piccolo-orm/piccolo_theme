## Docs

See [Read the docs](https://piccolo-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Typography

Roboto is used for the body copy, and Roboto Mono for code snippets. As these
fonts belong to the same family, they look nice together. Both of them are
also highly legible on small screens.

We use bold, easy to read headers.

## Code docs

We make your autodoc code snippets nice and legible:

## Dark mode, and darkest mode!

The Piccolo theme has a gorgeous dark mode. And for users with OLED displays,
we have the 'darkest' mode - where the backgrounds are pure black.
